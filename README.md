OMG, just finished Last Breath, and dude, what a ride! I seriously don’t know how I feel about it. Like, are these people even human?? I can't imagine what it’s like being stuck in a diving suit with only 5 mins of air left. I was sitting there thinking, Nah, he’s not gonna make it, and then BOOM, he does. Insane. And I'm over here just trying to survive Monday mornings, lol.

Did you get a chance to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   yet? You gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it. Once you're in, you're committed for sure. It’s like this crazy mix of stress and adrenaline, and you’re just like, “How? How???”

> Bruh. The part where they lose communication, though. That was some horror   vibes. I half expected some sea monster to pop up and say, “Jk guys, I got him!” 😂 But nah, just cold hard reality. It just gets you thinking about how tiny and insignificant we all are when we’re down there in the depths. Deep, man. Like, literally.

And those guys on the boat... I mean, talk about feeling useless, right? But also kinda reminds you of everyone trying to fix something with tape and hope. Like, go team “cross your fingers and hope it works!” You ever been in a situation like that? Just winging it and hoping not to crash n burn.

Oh, and that one dude's mentality... such a legend. I’d have been like, “Yup, this is how I go,” sipping my last imaginary cup of coffee. But they just keep going and trying and AHH. Seriously, my respect level rocketed.

function saveHuman() { return “phew!”; }

Anyway, I’m rambling now. So yeah, you gotta check it out. I promise, it’s worth every minute of stress-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨. Let me know when you do and we can totally freak out together 😂
